Every low-income immigrant asks this about their kids: “What can I do to make it so that life is easier for my kids? They also ask “what’s the easiest and fastest way for my kids to make it in life?” At least, that’s what my mom thought. As I approached college-age, she kept suggesting different majors and careers that she thought would help me get on the golden road of success as soon as possible (mainly so I could build her her dream house and give her money to travel). Most people know the stereotype of Asian parents wanting their kids to become doctors or lawyers for the money. Funnily enough, my parents never wanted that from me as they knew the price for those careers was too costly to afford. 

So what did my mother suggest? Why, careers with the highest money-to-study ratio. Least amount of studying for the most amount of work. Of course, the field still had to be prestigious. What field could that possibly be?

Being a pharmacist of course! What was her rationale? Her understanding was that becoming a pharmacist would take less years of study compared to other fields of medicine. That way, you could become a doctor earlier, make money faster, and start paying off your debt quicker. Much to mother’s credit, it was a good plan. Unfortunately for her, she was not alone in this line of thinking. When she first started as a pharmacy technician in the middle of the 2010s, she was telling all the kids of fellow Asian immigrants to become pharmacists. She was also telling the parents to become pharmacy technicians as the bar of entry was not too high. But quickly she changed her tune. From 2019 onwards, she was dissuading all kids from being a pharmacist as supply ran too high and jobs were scarce. 

But where does that lead us? The current computer science major crisis is something to marvel at. Yes, the job market currently is terrible overall, but the dramatic shift in the market for tech jobs was so sudden, I don’t think it could’ve happened any faster. It’s like the pharmacist issue, but on such a greater magnitude. 

I’d like to start off by saying this. If you haven’t already checked out the New York Times podcast on big tech’s effect on the current job market crisis, do so now: “[Big Tech Told Kids to Code. The Jobs Didn’t Follow](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/podcasts/the-daily/big-tech-told-kids-to-code-the-jobs-didnt-follow.html)”. It’s well worth the listen, and it provides a good call to action of what needs to happen so this issue doesn’t happen in the future. 

But even anecdotally, I knew of people who obtained jobs around the time when tech was most sought after (COVID forcing everyone remote). They were put on career fast-tracks as the amount of experienced individuals was crippling the tech companies who couldn’t keep up with demand. Nowadays, you could have oodles of experience and still never sniff an interview. 

The people who saw every single one of the “Day in the Life” videos, romanticizing the high-paying tech worker career are now stuck, grinding endlessly to fight amongst thousands of other individuals trapped in the same situation. The people who were spurned towards this type of career by the likes of my mother, thinking that computer science and tech was another cheat code to social mobility and stable wealth, now trapped in their college debt and thinking if its all their fault. 

What can we do about this? To be honest, I don’t really know. Companies are currently downsizing, thinking that AI will be able to replace core functions of the tech development cycle. That’s a whole different rant article in itself. The greater job market isn’t doing any better either, so heading to different fields may be tougher than times before. 

There is one thing to take away that I try to impart to all individuals that are currently wandering in college, trying to balance passion, stability, wealth and life. I tell all current college students and prospective ones to take a hard look at what world you’ll be stepping into.

There are many fields that require a true deep passion in the subject to succeed in the relevant fields. There are some that don’t. Understand that prestige is something that may come later. That beginning with stability allows one to later approach wealth and prestige easier. 

I hope that later groups of people will take a harder look into the careers they’re stepping into. Hopefully due to passion, but if not, then to avoid the situation that so many are in currently. 

As I’m writing this, the latest group of new college students that I see are starting to avoid the tech majors. But the last few years, all I saw were tech major students. May the best happen to each and every one of them.
